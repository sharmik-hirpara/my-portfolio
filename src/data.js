As a change manager/business UAT owner for Lifebroker, Sharmik was my key resource to get BAU & project technology changes delivered on time. In his time at TAL, Sharmik has worked on a variety of different business initiatives and challenges, all of which he fulfilled to a high standard. He has a vibrant & positive attitude and he is effective in articulating technical terms into language that the business can understand and make informed decisions from. Sharmik is always effective at addressing the underlying problem statement raised by the business, and there has been cross-pollination of skills/knowledge across our respective areas, which this has helped foster an excellent client/vendor relationship. Sharmik leaves TAL having made unlocked benefits to the business from a commercial, risk, brand/reputation standpoint. We will miss him greatly, and I would recommend him in a heartbeat!",
